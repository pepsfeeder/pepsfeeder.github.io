    <p>There are moments in history when it seemed like the world stopped. Like on Friday, November 22nd, a young President Kennedy was driving through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, TX. For just a little while, the day seemed beautiful and hopes were high, then in an instant, Jackie was scrambling over the back of the car and JFK was slumped down. He had been shot. The 10 photographs below captured some of the most intense moments in history, catching what happened literally seconds after famous assassinations. It&rsquo;s hard to describe just how many emotions you&rsquo;ll feel when you see these.</p>

Martin Luther King, Jr. was an American clergyman, activist, and prominent leader of the African-American civil rights movement and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who became known for his advancement of civil rights by using civil disobedience.
