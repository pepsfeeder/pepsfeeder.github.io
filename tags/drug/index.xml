      <description>Since Narcos series was out many people raised more interest about lord of drug and all-time controversial Narcotic persona Pablo Escobar, the series covered many areas about his life, his business and lot of interesting facts about, but the thing is, there is a lot more to Pablo Escobar story than what has been shown, if you didn’t watch Naroc yet, I’m telling to drop everything in your hand and head straight to your laptop and start watching it, it deserves your time.</description>
