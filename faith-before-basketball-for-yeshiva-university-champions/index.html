    <p>NEW YORK (AP) &mdash; Every of the mighty Maccabees has his role on the men&rsquo;s basketball personnel. Gabriel Leifer sinks three-pointers; Daniel Katz is the protection wizard; Simcha Halpert makes the correct alley-oop passes to Ryan Turell who soars for dunks.</p>
<p>Kids faux to be them in pickup games. The home crowd sings in Hebrew and roars when they score. However forward of tipoff, the personnel continuously gathers round Tyler Hod, a senior guard and their unofficial rabbi.</p>
<p>Reading passages from the Torah, Hod shares a fable, the whole whereas drawing lessons to inspire them on and off the court in a pregame ritual that ends when they huddle and inform: &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yeshiva College&rsquo;s basketball personnel can&rsquo;t play on the Sabbath, on Jewish Holidays or fast days. They&rsquo;ve additionally confronted anti-Semitic taunts and ethnic slurs from opponents and spectators. However they continue to beat their opponents, many proudly carrying the skullcap that identifies them as Jewish.</p>
<p>The trusty personnel in the Jewish Orthodox institution&rsquo;s historical past won the Skyline Convention on Sunday with followers flooding the court and celebrating. The Maccabees extended their story profitable amble to 27 games, beating Rob College 86-74 and qualifying for the NCAA Division III match. The championship is the 2d time in three years the college has won the title. Its first ever convention championship came in 2018. They reached the closing in 2019.</p>
<p><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAJCAAAAAAeQfPuAAAAC0lEQVQYGWMYrAAAAJkAAWzZLOIAAAAASUVORK5CIIA=" alt="ratio"></p>
<p><img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/QXfXXrfO-os/0.jpg" alt="Youtube video thumbnail"></p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s essential for us to capitalize on what we&rsquo;re going for and no longer perfect play to the closing day of convention however play to the closing day of the closing game of Division III basketball,&rdquo; co-captain Katz acknowledged on a day that began with practice proper after shatter of day, followed by morning prayer, and that ended with a used Shabbat dinner. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we desire to attain: purchase the nationwide championship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whimsical upward push for a personnel that had a spotty story competing in the Skyline Convention championship till it stepped into the highlight when it won it two years ago. This season, the Maccabees, named after the ragged Jewish rise up warriors, enjoy been unstoppable.</p>
<p>Their details encompass the correct launch at school historical past, the longest profitable amble and their first nationwide rating. Halpert additionally moved into third on the college&rsquo;s all-time scoring listing, forward of Hod&rsquo;s father, Lior Hod, a 1987-1988 personnel captain who details the games from the stands with a handheld digicam; whereas Turell became the first sophomore to succeed in 1,000 aspects.</p>
<p>It began with Elliot Steinmetz, a outdated YU participant, who in 2014 took the coaching job with one purpose: recruiting the correct Jewish gamers nationwide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sold us all on that dream of bringing Jewish basketball to the forefront and making us relevant,&rdquo; Halpert acknowledged. His brother, Eitan, additionally performs for the Macs. &ldquo;And we if truth be told bought into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This season they played one of their toughest games against Sarah Lawrence profitable when Leifer hit a three-pointer a couple of seconds forward of the buzzer. In the locker room, their coach reminded them that it goes beyond basketball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You peep all these youngsters who must purchase an image with you &ndash; they bear in mind these guys who won two years ago,&rdquo; Steinmetz acknowledged about the legion of younger followers who snap selfies with the gamers after the games. &ldquo;You can perchance enjoy a probability to listing your college and one thing larger … you enjoy a probability for one thing extraordinarily special.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gamers attain from across the U.S. Some turned down affords at Ivy League and Division I faculties to play for Yeshiva. They additionally fluctuate in their observance of their faith &ndash; from Hod who will saunter to rabbinical faculty after he graduates this yr, to Ofek Reef, a 6-foot freshman from Texas who goes on the court with out the skullcap, carrying tattoos and a Huge name of David-shaped earring, and who enthralls the crowds when he defies gravity and dunks over taller opponents. All of them, though, are united by their Jewish identity and their fancy of basketball.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I enjoy a cessation connection to God,&rdquo; acknowledged Turell, a 6-foot-7-level guard from Los Angeles, who turned down a probability to attend West Point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So as to study my religion and to play basketball on the same time at a excessive level is fantastic. It&rsquo;s the higher of both worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many of the gamers met at excessive faculty tournaments, or at a Jerusalem camp flee by Tamir Goodman, who became dubbed in 1999 by Sports actions Illustrated journal as &ldquo;The Jewish Jordan.&rdquo; He retired on the age of 27 after enjoying in college in the U.S., and professionally in Israel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I spy YU play, there are two ranges of pleasure: on the macro, these guys are provocative the whole world,&rdquo; Goodman acknowledged in a phone interview. &ldquo;And on the micro: I&rsquo;m proud on story of I labored if truth be told no longer easy with diverse of those guys in Jerusalem at some level of camps and in the gymnasium. I enjoy tears in my eyes. It&rsquo;s like one of my youngsters enjoying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a brotherhood: Some lived collectively for years in dorms after which moved to the same building after they married. On the avenue, they&rsquo;ll gain a room to wrap the leather-primarily based fully straps of tefillin and pray collectively. At home court, they practice taking pictures and drills early in the morning, taking note of rap.</p>
<p>They attend Jewish classes on high of their other coursework and customarily they kick again out with a reduce of kosher pizza and enjoying &ldquo;Fortnite&rdquo; or the NBA 2K videogame. Their families chat on WhatsApp and flee or pressure lengthy distances to spy them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is compulsory just isn&rsquo;t any longer perfect that the Macs are profitable &ndash; it is some distance the type they are profitable: with selflessness, teamwork and mighty sportsmanship,&rdquo; acknowledged Rabbi Ari Berman, the president of Yeshiva. &ldquo;They are an embodiment of our mission to issue our particular Jewish values out into the arena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Macs additionally peep themselves as ambassadors for their Jewish identity at a time of an alarming assortment of latest anti-Semitic assaults across the U.S. Rising up in Baltimore, Katz remembers coins being thrown at him from the bleachers. Even this day, some enjoy confronted hateful chants and jeers from the stands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We bought a couple of avenue games some distance-off, and the crowds enjoy been very loud,&rdquo; acknowledged Halpert, a co-captain who is is named a sharpshooter. &ldquo;There became one time that they were chanting: &ldquo;Hitler became proper!&rdquo; … It&rsquo;s the 21st century. There&rsquo;s no room for that more or much less abominate in any capability. I are trying no longer to harp on it loads, however we&rsquo;ve heard quite rather a lot of things. I perfect philosophize the guys: we&rsquo;re perfect here to play ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For years, their coach told them to ignore the taunts and anti-Semitic slurs. Steinmetz acknowledged that modified this yr and he has asked his gamers to story it. Security has additionally elevated with New York police officers on the games. However it with out a doubt has no longer deterred the staunch followers of the Macs.</p>
<p>Rabbi Yigal Sklarin, and his 9-yr-feeble son Yonatan, are among the many loads of who enjoy the Max Stern Athletic Middle for home games and notice them on the avenue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t enjoy a tv at home, so we simplest know Yeshiva College Maccabees basketball,&rdquo; Sklarin acknowledged. &ldquo;He can name more gamers on the Macs than he can in the NBA,&rdquo; he acknowledged smiling at his son in the stands. &ldquo;When he performs at home on his basketball, he acts out like he&rsquo;s the Macs. He&rsquo;ll purchase his free throws like Ryan Turell.</p>
<p>He&rsquo;ll saunter: ‘It&rsquo;s Simcha, to Ryan to Gabe for the dunk'… It&rsquo;s like you&rsquo;re for your yard saying: ‘Michael Jordan for three' &ndash; he says: ‘Simcha, for three!'</p>
