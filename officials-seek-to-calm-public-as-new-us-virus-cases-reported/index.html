<p>Biden claimed the administration doesn&rsquo;t maintain testing kits. Pence and Azar acknowledged hundreds of kits had been allotted.</p>
<p>Azar acknowledged he didn&rsquo;t know what Biden became as soon as talking about when the dilapidated vp acknowledged testing kits didn&rsquo;t exist. Azar acknowledged the Center for Illness Alter and Prevention had developed a lab check for coronavirus with &ldquo;ancient flow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pence became as soon as interviewed on CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;Say of the Union&rdquo; and Azar commented on &ldquo;Fox Recordsdata Sunday,&rdquo; CBS' &ldquo;Face the Nation&rdquo; and ABC&rsquo;s &ldquo;This Week.&rdquo; Biden commented on CNN.</p>
